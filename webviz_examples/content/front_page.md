![width=40%,height=300px](./webviz-logo.svg "Welcome to the webviz-subsurface example application.")

Webviz is designed for analysing FMU model results.

This webviz live demo is based on multi-realization data sets (ensembles) generated from the synthetic Drogon FMU model.

Webviz is created from a yaml configuration file, and this demo also includes an advanced menu example (grouping w/icons).
The configuration file used for making this demo app is included in *"Webviz Intro Menu - Information - How was this made"*.

Click on the different pages in the **Webviz Intro** and the **Webviz Analysis** to start exploring the Webviz capabilities and plugins!
